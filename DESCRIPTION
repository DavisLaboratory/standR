Description: standR is an user-friendly R package providing functions to assist conducting 
    good-practice analysis of Nanostring's GeoMX DSP data. All functions in the package are 
    built based on the SpatialExperiment object, allowing integration into various spatial
    transcriptomics-related packages from Bioconductor. standR allows data inspection, quality
    control, normalization, batch correction and evaluation with informative visualizations.
